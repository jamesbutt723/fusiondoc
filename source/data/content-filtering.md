Content Filtering in Fusion
===========================

Content filtering in Fusion is optional much in the same way schemas are optional. You could always create a content source that returns the entirety of an ANS-compliant document or any other external data format with no filtering or refinement at all if you so desire. However, you will likely run into a scenario in which you will not want the entirety of an API repsonse or document delivered to the front-end for a feature to use.

Content filtering uses a subset of [GraphQL's query format](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/). More specifically, Fusion only supports [fields](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fields). Arguments, aliases, fragments, etc. will not work and will in fact cause errors when we attempt to use them.

Provided you are working with a data structure that is consistent enough that this kind of GraphQL field filtering is applicable, then this filtering functionality is an option you can certainly consider for mitigating any issues you might have with especially large data payloads.

However, there are multiple places in Fusion where you can do this kind of filtering: At the feature level with the Consumer API, at feature level using using the Fusion-provided React hooks, or at the content source level.

Feature-level content filtering
-------------------------------

If an individual feature is pulling in data for rendering in class component using the Consumer API, we typically use content filtering by passing in a `filter` field in the appropriate function provided by that decorator: Either `getContent()` or `fetchContent()`. Similarly, if one is using a React hook to fetch content such as `useContent` you'll pass in the filter string in the content config that gets passed in that hook function.

Borrowing from the example for `getContent()`

    componentDidMount () {
        const { fetched } = this.getContent({
            sourceName: 'dark-sky',
            query: { lat: 29.977327, lng: 31.133426 },
        })
    
        fetched.then(response => {
            this.setState({ forecast: response.daily.summary })
        })
    }
    

Here the filter field in the object passed into `getContent` is `'{ daily { summary }}'` which refines the response structure returning from our content source down to something that will look like this:

    {
        "daily": {
            "summary" : "No precipitation throughout the week, with high temperatures rising to 110Â°F on Tuesday."
        }
    }
    

Content source-level content filtering
--------------------------------------

It's very possible you may also see a need to filter content at the content source level to apply a set of filtering rules without needing to do it through the Consumer API at the feature level.

There are two main reasons you may see a need to do this:

*   You want to filter content fetched for `globalContent`.
*   You want to apply the same filtering for all queries made to a content source.

Luckily, filters are applied in content sources very similarly to how feature-level content filtering is applied.

Here's an example of our `dark-sky` content source from before but with same filtering applied at the content source level:

    export default {
        resolve: query => `https://api.darksky.net/forecast/YOUR_API_KEY/${query.lat},${query.long}`,
        params: {
            lat: 'number',
            long: 'number'
        },
        filter: '{ daily { summary }}'
    }
    

Now any fetches for this content source, whether it be for feature-scoped content or for global content, will apply that filter and return data refined in the same way as in our feature-level filtering example.

Order of operations (What happens in what order? Where does it happen?)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You may be wondering if you could do filtering in both the content source and the feature content requests. The answer is yes, but you'll need to be conscious of the order in which each of those filters happens.

Additionally, if you're using data transforms in addition to content filtering, you'll want to keep in mind the order of operations for how transforms and filters get applied and where they are used, i.e. server, client, or both.

In the following list number 1 is applied first and number 4 is applied last:

1.  Content source transform **(Server)**
2.  Content source filter **(Server)**
3.  Feature content request filter **(Server)**
4.  Feature content request transform **(Server AND Client)**

Notice that that the transform happens before the filter within content sources but for feature content. This is different from how it happens in features content requests, where the filtering is applied before the transform.

This order of operations is important to consider in the event you're conscious of payload size or preventing secret/encrypted data from being delivered to the client. Essentially, if you're relying on a feature content request transform to prevent that data from being available to the client, that is to say it will not work as expected. All other data manipulation points in that list should function adequately for that purpose, though.
